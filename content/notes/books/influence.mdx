- Thousands of different tactics compliance practitioners employ to produce yes. Majority fall within six categories. Each governed by fundamental psychological principle directing human behavior
- Automatic, fixed-action patterns of animals work well great majority of time. Takes trickster to make natural response seem silly.
- Retail: Might balk at idea of spending $95 for sweater, but if you just bought $495 suit, sweater doesn't seem excessive. "The interesting thing is that even when a man enters a clothing store with the express purpose of purchasing a suit, he will almost always pay more for whatever accessories he buys if he buys them after the suit purchase than before."
- Real estate: When showing customers new houses, started with undesirable "setup" properties maintained by company at inflated prices so genuine properties in would benefit from comparison.
- Automobile dealers: use contrast principle by waiting until price negotiated before suggesting options. After $15k deal, hundreds of dollars seems trivial.

## 1. Reciprocation

- Obligated to future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like.
- Possesses awesome strength, often producing "yes" response to request that, except for existing feeling of indebtedness, would have surely been refused. Even if they dislike you and even if return favor is substantially larger.
- Often asymmetrical, can choose initial favor and form of return favor like Hare Krishna Society members' flowers for donations. Could say no to both of offers, but can sometimes be tough choices due to cultural pressure to reciprocate.
- Another consequence of rule: obligation to make concession to someone who has made concession to us. Leads to rejection-then-retreat technique: to increase chances I'll agree to something, make larger request I'm likely to turn down. Then, after refusal, make smaller request you wanted all along. I'll view second as concession to me and feel inclined accept.
- Larger initial request, more effective procedure, but only up to point. If seen as unreasonable, it backfires. Con artist aims for exaggerated enough to allow for series of reciprocal concessions yielding desirable final offer, yet not so outlandish as to be seen as illegitimate.
- People who wouldn't otherwise subject friends sales presentation agree to supply referrals when presented as concession from purchase request they've just refused. Note: Has to be phrased as concession.
- Strangely enough, then, rejection-then-retreat spurs people not only to agree to desired request but actually carry it out and even volunteer to perform further requests.
- Requester's concession not only causes targets to say yes more often, it also causes them to feel more responsible for having "dictated" the final agreement, feel responsible for terms of contract and live up to it.
- Accept desirable first offers of others but accept offers only for what they fundamentally are, not for what they are represented to be. If initial favor turns out to be trick designed to stimulate compliance with return favor, recognize and refuse. Favors are met with favors; tricks are not.

## 2. Commitment and Consistency

- After making choice or taking stand, encounter personal/interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment and respond in ways justifying earlier decision. The more public a stand, more reluctant we are to change it.
- 4/20 tried to stop thief at beach. However, if accomplice asked subject to "watch my things," 19/20 became virtual vigilantes, running after/stopping thief, demanding explanation, and often  physically restraining.
- Transcendental meditation seminar, author's colleague completely refuted core premise, which caused MORE people to sign up. Explanation: desperately seeking solution to problems. Found potential solution in TM and wanted to believe. When voice of reason intruded, panic! Signed up before logic took hold and they were, again, left without hope. "Quick, a hiding place from thought! Here, take this money. Whew, safe in the nick of time. No need to think about the issues any longer. The decision has been made, and from now on the consistency tape can be played whenever necessary: 'TM? Certainly I think it will help me; certainly I expect to continue; certainly I believe in TM. I already put my money down for it, didn't I?'"
- Volunteer went door-to-door asking to display three-inch-square sign reading BE A SAFE DRIVER, nearly all agreed. However, were later remarkably willing to comply with much larger sign, called foot-in-the-door tactic. Citizens into "public servants," prospects into "customers," prisoners into "collaborators." Once self-image is where you want it, they comply naturally with range of requests consistent with view of themselves.
- Big companies run "100 words or less" testimonial contests, "Why I likeâ€¦". Purpose: get as many people as possible to go on record as liking product.
- Thonga tribesman watching sons tremble through nights in "yard of mysteries," college students enduring Hell Night not acts of sadism, but of group survival. Function to spur future members, oddly, to find group more attractive/worthwhile.
- Social scientists have determined we accept inner responsibility for behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in absence of strong outside pressures.
- Lowballing: advantage offered inducing favorable purchase decision; then, sometime later, advantage deftly removed. Example: promise of newspaper publicity for low energy usage. Caused them to acquire new energy habits, feeling good about efforts, convincing themselves of need to reduce dependence on foreign fuel, began viewing themselves as conservation-minded.

## 3. Social Proof

- Tendency to assume that action is more correct if others are doing it. Infomercials ("fastest-growing" or "largest-selling"), bartenders "salting" tip jars, etc.
- Don't have to convince us product is good, only that many others think so
- Researcher selected severely withdrawn children from preschools, showed them film of children own age interacting. Immediately began to interact with peers at equal level as others. Six weeks later, leading schools in social activity. Twenty-three-minute movie, viewed once, was enough to reverse pattern of lifelong maladaptive behavior.
- Overarching need of cultists to cling to beliefs: "I have to believe the flood is coming because I've spent all my money. I quit my job, I quit computer school...I have to believe."
- If they could spread Word, inform uninformed, persuade skeptics, and if, by so doing, they could win converts, threatened but treasured beliefs would become truer.
- In times of uncertainty, tendency to look at actions of others for clues. Easy to forget everybody else is doing same thing. We prefer to appear poised among others, so interpreted as nonemergency and fail to act.
- Research: 75 percent of lone individuals who observed smoke under door reported leak; however, in three-person groups, smoke reported only 38 percent of time. When two coached to ignore smoke, leaks reported only 10 percent of time.
- Isolate one individual from crowd: Stare, speak, and point directly at person and no one else: "You, sir, in the blue jacket, I need help. Call an ambulance."
- We use actions of others to decide proper behavior for ourselves, especially for those similar to ourselves. True for adults, teens, and children.

## 4. Authority

- Physician ordered ear drops administered. Instead "right ear", abbreviated "place in R ear" Duty nurse promptly put required drops into patient's anus. Neither patient nor nurse questioned it.
- Twenty-two separate nurses' stations, researchers made identical call. Identified himself as hospital physician, directed nurse to give drug to patient. (1) Prescription over phone, os violation of policy. (2) Medication unauthorized. (3) Dosage twice maximum dose. (4) Directive given by man nurse had never met/seen/talked to. 95 percent complied.
- Clothing also has authority, both uniform and tailored business suit.
- Waiter that received much larger tips: In larger groups, no matter what first person selected, he'd furrow brow, look quickly over shoulder for manager, lean toward table for all to hear, "I'm afraid that's not as good tonight as it normally is. Might I recommend instead the____or the____?" (suggesting items about fifty cents less to gain trust) "They are both excellent tonight."

## 5. Liking

- Good-looking people enjoy enormous social advantage in our culture: better liked, more persuasive, more frequently helped, seen as possessing better personality traits/intellectual capacities.
<!-- HERE -->
- We like people who are similar to us. This fact seems to hold true whether the similarity is in the area of opinions, personality traits, background, or life-style.
- Several studies have demonstrated that we are more likely to help those who dress like us.
- Another way requesters can manipulate similarity to increase liking and compliance is to claim that they have backgrounds and interests similar to ours.
- Many sales training programs now urge trainees to "mirror and match" the customer's body posture, mood, and verbal style, as similarities along each of these dimensions have been shown to lead to positive results.
- Each month he sent every one of his more than thirteen thousand former customers a holiday greeting card containing a personal message. The holiday greeting changed from month to month (Happy New Year or Happy Thanksgiving, etc.), but the message printed on the face of the card never varied. It read, "I like you."
- pure praise did not have to be accurate to work. Positive comments produced just as much liking for the flatterer when they were untrue as when they were true.70
- We can trace the roots of this surprising turnabout to those times when the boys had to view one another as allies instead of opponents. The crucial procedure was the experimenters' imposition of common goals on the groups. It was the cooperation required to achieve these goals that finally allowed the rival group members to experience one another as reasonable fellows, valued helpers, and friends.
- Did you ever wonder what all those good-looking models are doing standing around in the automobile ads? What the advertiser hopes they are doing is lending their positive traitsâ€”beauty and desirabilityâ€”to the cars. The advertiser is betting that we will respond to the product in the same ways we respond to the attractive models merely associated with it.
- In one study, men who saw a new-car ad that included a seductive young woman model rated the car as faster, more appealing, more expensive-looking, and better designed than did men who viewed the same ad without the model. Yet when asked later, the men refused to believe that the presence of the young woman had influenced their judgments.85
- subjects became fonder of the people and things they experienced while they were eating.

- Note also that nothing similar occurs in the case of failure. No television viewer will ever hear the chant, "We're in last place! We're in last place!" Home-team defeats are the times for distancing oneself. Here "we" is not nearly as preferred as the insulating pronoun "they."
- we have to be sensitive to only one thing related to liking in our contacts with compliance practitioners: the feeling that we have come to like the practitioner more quickly or more deeply than we would have expected. Once we notice this feeling, we will have been tipped off that there is probably some tactic being used, and we can start taking the necessary countermeasures.

## 6. Scarcity

- The Scarcity Scam Note how the scarcity principle was employed during the second and third phone calls to cause Mr. Gulban to "buy quickly without thinking too much about it."
- there is a unique, secondary source of power within the scarcity principle: As opportunities become less available, we lose freedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have. This desire to preserve our established prerogatives is the centerpiece of psychological reactance theory, developed by psychologist Jack Brehm to explain the human response to diminishing personal control. According to the theory, whenever free choice is limited or threatened, the need to retain our freedoms makes us desire them (as well as the goods and services associated with them) significantly more than previously. So when increasing scarcityâ€”or anything elseâ€”interferes with our prior access to some item, we will react against the interference by wanting and trying to possess the item more than before.107
- Although the terrible twos may be the most noticeable age of psychological reactance, we show the strong tendency to react against restrictions on our freedoms of action throughout our lives. One other age does stand out, however, as a time when this tendency takes an especially rebellious form: teenage. Like the twos, this is a period characterized by an emerging sense of individuality. For teenagers, the emergence is from the role of child, with all of its attendant parental control, and toward the role of adult, with all of its attendant rights and duties. Not surprisingly, adolescents tend to focus less on the duties than on the rights they feel they have as young adults. Not surprisingly, again, imposing traditional parental authority at these times is often counterproductive; the teenager will sneak, scheme, and fight to resist such attempts at control.
- This raises the worrisome possibility that especially clever individuals holding a weak or unpopular position can get us to agree with that position by arranging to have their message restricted. The irony is that for such peopleâ€”members of fringe political groups, for exampleâ€”the most effective strategy may not be to publicize their unpopular views, but to get those views officially censored and then to publicize the censorship.
- The idea that newly experienced scarcity is the more powerful kind applies to situations well beyond the bounds of the cookie study. For example, social scientists have determined that such scarcity is a primary cause of political turmoil and violence. Perhaps the most prominent proponent of this argument is James C. Davies, who states that we are most likely to find revolutions where a period of improving economic and social conditions is followed by a short, sharp reversal in those conditions. Thus it is not the traditionally most downtrodden peopleâ€”who have come to see their deprivation as part of the natural order of thingsâ€”who are especially liable to revolt. Instead, revolutionaries are more likely to be those who have been given at least some taste of a better life. When the economic and social improvements they have experienced and come to expect suddenly become less available, they desire them more than ever and often rise up violently to secure them.
- As we have seen in the case of political freedoms and (especially pertinent to the present discussion) chocolate-chip cookies, people see a thing as more desirable when it has recently become less available than when it has been scarce all along. We should not be surprised, then, when research shows that parents who enforce discipline inconsistently produce generally rebellious children.119
- Epilogue Instant Influence
- We have been exploring several of the most popular of the single pieces of information that we use to prompt our compliance decisions. They are the most popular prompts precisely because they are the most reliable ones, those that normally point us toward the correct choice. That is why we employ the factors of reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity so often and so automatically in making our compliance decisions. Each, by itself, provides a highly reliable cue as to when we will be better off saying yes than no.
