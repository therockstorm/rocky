- Trichotomy of control
- Voluntary discomfort
- Respond to insults with humor or nothing at all, the latter insults the insulter without insulting. Either the insult is true, in which case we should be grateful for them pointing out an area of improvement, or it is false, in which case we should pity the insulter for his lack of accurate perception. Either way, an insult is nothing to get upset about.
- Let reason triumph over your reflexive emotions
- Learn to want the things you already have
- "What's the worst that could happen?": You won't be surprised, be better prepared, and be grateful for what you have. And that's a prescription for perseverance.
- Use "reserve clause": "Fate permitting", it will help you persist after disappointment. (If not, it's out of my control.)
- "View from above": Put things in perspective. Whatever occurred, it's probably not the worst thing that has ever happened.
- "What would your hero do?"
