- Financial education night: play monopoly, openly discuss your own financial situations, discuss their goals. Schools don't teach this, you have to.
- Cash flow quadrants: Entrepreneurs and investors enable financial independence, working for someone else or being self-employed don't. Education systems train for latter, which is why those that do well in school tend to be in these categories.
- Ordinary, passive/cash flow (rental income), and portfolio income. Only taught the first in school, have highest taxes.
- Wide variety of experiences early in career is more important than minimum wage paycheck.
- Don't give your kids handouts to avoid entitlement. Reward for work well done/effort/generosity.
- Difference between financial advice and education. Give them the tools to make their own decisions.
