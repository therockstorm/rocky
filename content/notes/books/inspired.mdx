- Getting to Product/Market Fit
  - Money/time tight, startups must be optimized to learn and move quickly, very little bureaucracy to slow them down. Few that succeed usually really good at product discover.
- Growth‐Stage Companies: Scaling to Success
  - In addition to hiring lots more people, need to figure out how to replicate earlier successes with new, adjacent products and services while growing core business as fast as possible.
- At least half ideas on roadmap are not going to deliver what you hope (really good teams assume at least three quarters of ideas won't perform like they hope)
- Biggest flaw of waterfall: all risk is at the end, which means customer validation happens way too late. Key to Lean methods reducing waste, one of biggest forms of waste is to design, build, test, deploy feature/product only to find out it is not what was needed. Many teams believe they're applying Lean principles; yet, they follow the waterfall process: work for months on what they call MVP, don't know what they have and whether it will sell until they've spent substantial time/money—hardly Lean.
- Best product teams have already moved past how most teams practice these methods—leveraging core principles of Lean and Agile, but raising bar on what they're trying to achieve and how they work. Three overarching principles:
  1. Risks tackled up front, prior to deciding to build anything, rather than at end. Risks include:
    1. Value risk (whether customers will buy it)
    1. Usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it)
    1. Feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills, and tech we have)
    1. Business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business—sales, marketing, finance, legal, etc.)
  1. Products defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially. Moved beyond PM defining requirements, designer designing solution, engineering implementing. Instead, product, design, and engineering work side by side, in a give‐and‐take way, to come up with technology‐powered solutions
  1. All about solving problems, not implementing features. Conventional roadmaps are all about output. It's not only about implementing solution. Must ensure solution solves underlying problem. It's about business results.
- Two essential high‐level activities product teams: discover product to be built, and deliver that product to market. Done in parallel, PM and designer discover necessary product while engineers deliver.
- Discovery: intense collaboration of PM, user experience design, and engineering. Tackling various risks before we write one line of code. Purpose is to quickly separate good ideas from bad. Output is validated backlog. Specifically, get answers to four risks listed above.
- Discovery involves running series of quick experiments, done quickly/inexpensively, use prototypes rather than products, require order of magnitude less time and effort.
- Product vision: longer‐term objective of this product, normally 2–10 years out. How we as product org intend to deliver on company's mission. Use prototypes to conduct rapid experiments in discovery, then build/release products to test/achieve product/market fit, which is step on the way to delivering on product vision.
- Concept of minimum viable product (MVP) is one of most important concepts in product world.
  - Able to convince vast majority they could have achieved same MVP learning in fraction of time/effort. Months building MVP, could have had same learning in days or, sometimes, hours.
  - Should be prototype, not product. Building actual product‐quality deliverable to learn, even if deliverable has minimal functionality, leads to substantial waste of time/money, antithesis of Lean.
- Mercenaries build whatever they're told to build. Missionaries are true believers in vision and committed to solving problems for their customers. In dedicated product team, team acts and feels much like startup within larger company, very much intention.
- Product teams are there to solve hard problems for business. Given clear objectives, own/are empowered to figure out best way to deliver on those objectives, accountable for the results.
- PM needs to be among strongest company talent. Without tech sophistication, business savvy, credibility with key executives, deep customer knowledge, passion for product, or respect of product team, sure recipe for failure.
- Responsible for evaluating opportunities and determining what gets built and delivered to customers. Describe what needs to get built on product backlog. Hard to make sure what's on backlog is worth building, engineers/designers want to see evidence.
- PM considered so important by CEOs/VCs because every business depends on customers. What they buy—or choose to use—is your product. Product is result of what product team builds, and PM is responsible for what product team will build. When product succeeds, it's because everyone on team did what they needed to do. But when a product fails, it's PM's fault. PM is proving ground for future CEOs, VCs want to invest in company with proven product people as co‐founder.
- Four key responsibilities of strong PM:
  - Deep Knowledge of Customer First. Need to become expert on customer: their issues, pains, desires, how they think—and for business products, how they work, and how they decide to buy.
  - Deep Knowledge of Data and Analytics. Both quantitative and qualitative skills. Most PMs start day with half hour in analytics tools, understanding last 24 hours. Sales/usage analytics, A/B tests results.
  - Deep Knowledge of Your Business. How it works, role your product plays in your business. This means knowing various stakeholders and constraints they operate under. Convincing each stakeholder you understand their constraints, are committed to only delivering solutions consistent with those constraints.
- Deep Knowledge of Your Market and Industry. Not only competitors but key trends in tech, customer behaviors and expectations, relevant industry analysts, and understanding role of social media for your market and customers. Most markets have more competitors than ever before making sticky products, difficult for prospective customers to move from your competitor to you. Not enough to have feature parity with competitor, need to be substantially better to motivate switch. In some companies, so much industry.domain knowledge that PM supplemented with subject matter experts.
- Successful PM must be best versions of
  - Smart. Not raw IQ, intellectually curious, quickly learning/applying new technologies to solve problems for customers, reach new audiences, enable new business models.
  - Creative. Think outside normal product box of features to solve business problems.
  - Persistent, push companies way beyond comfort zone with compelling evidence, constant communication, and building bridges across functions in face of stubborn resistance.
- Start by becoming expert in users/customers/product/industry. Share openly what you learn, both good and bad. Become company's go‐to person for understanding anything about customer—quantitative and qualitative. Work to establish strong relationship with key stakeholders/business partners. Convince them of two things: (1) You understand constraints they operate under. (2) You will only bring to them solutions that you believe will work within those constraints. Work hard to build/nurture strong collaborative relationship with product team.
- Most similar to role of CEO. PM must deeply understand all aspects of business. PM must ensure business outcome, not just ensure product gets defined. Requires good understanding of interrelated parts/constraints of business—financial, marketing, sales, legal, partnership, service, customer environment, technical capabilities, user's experience—and figure out solution that works for all.
- Designer sits side by side with PM, full partner on product discovery. UX is any way customers/end users realize value provided by product. Includes all touch points/interactions  customer has with company/product. Multiple interfaces, e‐mail, marketing campaigns, sales process, customer support, etc.
- Good Designers think about customer's journey over time as they interact with product/company. Constantly test ideas with real users/customers. Built into weekly cadence, they're constantly validating/refining ideas, collecting new insights they might not have been looking for. User testing broader than usability testing. Designers and product teams utilize opportunity to assess value of ideas. Will customers use or buy the product and, if not, why not? Questions to consider:
  - How will customers first learn about product?
  - How will we onboard first‐time user and (perhaps gradually) reveal new functionality?
  - How might users interact at different times during their day?
  - What other things are competing for user's attention?
  - How might things be different for one‐month‐old customer versus one‐year‐old customer?
  - How will we motivate user to higher level of commitment to product?
  - How will we create moments of gratification?
  - How will user share their experience with others?
  - How will customers receive offline service?
  - What is perceived responsiveness of product?
- In strong teams, design informs functionality at least as much as functionality drives design; hugely important concept. Need to make design first‐class member of team. Five keys to successful relationship:
  1. Do whatever you need to do to have designer sit next to you.
  1. Include designer from inception of every idea.
  1. Include designer in as many customer and user interactions as possible. Learn about users and customers together.
  1. Fight temptation to provide designer with your own design ideas. Give them as much room as possible to solve design challenges themselves.
  1. Encourage designer to iterate early and often. Get nitpicky about details with early iterations. Encourage to not just iterate on particular design approach but to explore alternative solutions to problem.
- Involve engineers deeply in customer pain/business problems you're trying to solve.
- Product marketing managers represent market to product team—positioning, messaging, winning go‐to‐market plan. Deeply engaged with sales channel and know their capabilities, limitations, and current competitive issues.
- To ensure holistic view of how entire system fits together, we have tech org leader (CTO/VP engineering). Often helped by group of engineering managers and directors and/or software architects. Critically essential role for companies with large/complex systems, usually direct report to head of tech.
- Don't lose these people! Take care of them, don't give them reason to leave or feel need to become manager to make more money. Second, always develop more of these people, each should have at least one person they're developing.
- Single most important responsibility of VP product: develop strong team of PMs/designers. Make recruiting, training, ongoing coaching top priority.
- Good product orgs have strong team, solid vision, consistent execution. Great orgs add strong product culture: team understands importance of continuous/rapid testing/learning. Understand need for mistakes in order to learn, but need to make them quickly and mitigate risks. Need for continuous innovation. Know great products are result of true collaboration. Respect/value their designers/engineers. Understand power of motivated product team.
- Some Group PMs (GPMs) go on to become director/VP of PM, some principal PM, and some stay GPM because they love blend of hands‐on working with own product team and ability to influence other teams/PMs through coaching.
- Leader of engineering org (VP engineering or CTO): Org responsible for architecture, engineering, quality, site operations, site security, release/delivery management. Group responsible for building/running company's products/services.
- Hallmark of great CTO is continual strive for tech as strategic enabler for business/products. Removing tech as barrier, as well as broadening art of possible for business/product leaders. Six major responsibilities in priority order:
  1. Organization: build excellent org with strong management team committed to developing skills of employees. Measure effectiveness by looking at development plans for employees, retention rate, and evaluation of managers/overall product/tech org by rest of company.
  1. Leadership: represent tech in strategic direction/leadership of company, working with other company executives to inform direction, M&A activity, and build/buy/partner decisions.
  1. Delivery: ensure org can rapidly, reliably, repeatedly deliver quality product to market. Several measures of delivery, including consistency/frequency of release vehicles, and quality/reliability of delivered/launched software. Main obstacle to rapid delivery often tech debt, responsibility of CTO to ensure that company is keeping this at manageable level.
  1. Architecture: ensure company has architecture capable of delivering functionality, scalability, reliability, security and performance it needs to compete and thrive. CTO needs to be leader in cohesive tech strategy looking at sum, not just parts. CTO is orchestrator of company‐wide tech strategy. Measures for architecture will vary, but in general, ensure infra continuously monitored and advanced to keep pace with growth of business, measure customer-impacting outages due to infra or architectural issues.
  1. Discovery: ensure members of senior engineering staff participating actively/contributing significantly throughout product discovery. If engineers/architects only used to write software, only getting fraction of value.
  1. Evangelism: CTO serves as company spokesperson for engineering org, demonstrating leadership in community with developers, partners, and customers. Measured by establishing university relations/recruitment program, sponsoring/participating in several events/year in developer community.
- Delivery managers mission is removing obstacles, also team Scrum Master. Help team get stuff live faster. Falls to PM and eng managers without these roles. Once org hits 5 to 10 product teams, this role becomes important.
- Many people crave recipe for structuring product teams, there isn't one. Critical core principles:
  - Alignment with investment strategy. Many companies have teams as reflections of ongoing investments, have certain teams because they've always had them. Phase out products no longer carrying weight. Need to have investment strategy and team structure should be reflection of that.
  - Minimize Dependencies. Helps teams move faster, be more autonomous. Dependencies change over time, continuously ask how they can be reduced.
  - Ownership and Autonomy. Should feel empowered, yet accountable for significant part of product offering.
  - Maximize Leverage. As orgs grow, often find common needs, increased importance of shared services. Realize, however, creating shared services also creates dependencies and can impinge on autonomy.
  - Product Vision/Strategy. Vision describes where org is trying to go in two to five years, strategy describes major milestones to get there.
  - Team Size. Min two engineers, one, and only one, PM, and designer if user-facing. Max 10–12 engineers.
  - Alignment with Architecture. In practice, primary principle for structuring teams is architecture. While we'd love every team to be full stack, not always option in practice. For larger companies, typical to have common services/platform teams. Staff with strong, highly technical PMs (platform PMs).
  - Alignment with User or Customer. If, for example, company provides a two‐sided marketplace, real advantages to having some teams focus on buyers vs sellers.
  - Alignment with Business. In larger companies, often have multiple lines of business with common foundation for products. If tech truly independent, we'd treat them as essentially different companies. Roughly similar to aligning by customer type, but business units often selling to same actual customers.
  - Structure Is Moving Target. Org's needs should/will change over time. Review every year or so.
  - Source of Innovation.
- Great companies disrupt themselves before others disrupt them. Product leadership.
- One of key themes of book is focusing on outcome, not output. Typical product roadmaps focus on output, are root cause of most waste/failed efforts in product orgs. No escaping these inconvenient truths:
  - At least half of product ideas aren't going to work. Customers aren't excited about it, want/try to use it, but too complicated.
  - Even with valuable ideas, typically takes several iterations to get execution delivering business value management was hoping for, often referred to as time to money.
- Weak teams plod through roadmap month after month, strong teams understand/embrace truths. Quickly tackle risks, iterate to effective solution. This is what product discovery is, most important core competency of product org. Prototype/test ideas with users, customers, engineers, business stakeholders in hours/days—rather than weeks/months—it changes dynamics and results.
- Anytime you put list of ideas on document called "roadmap," no matter the disclaimers, people across company interpret it as commitment. You're committed to building/delivering now, even when it doesn't solve underlying problem.
- Roadmaps serve two purposes
  1. Management wants to make sure teams are working on highest‐business‐value items
  1. Sometimes need to make date‐based commitments, roadmap allows tracking those commitments.
- New roadmap mode: management provides each team specific business objectives. Prioritizes business results rather than product ideas.
- Compromise for dates: product team does discovery, then commits to dates/deliverables. These types of commitments are minimized.
- Product strategy is sequence of products/releases delivered to realize product vision. Aligns product work with sales/marketing orgs. Sell in markets we've demonstrated product/market fit.
- 10 principles for effective product vision:
  1. Start with why.
  1. Fall in love with problem, not solution.
  1. Don't be afraid to think big with vision.
  1. Don't be afraid to disrupt yourselves because, if you don't, someone else will.
  1. Needs to inspire.
  1. Determine/embrace relevant/meaningful trends.
  1. Skate to where puck is heading, not to where it was.
  1. Be stubborn on vision but flexible on details.
  1. Realize any product vision is leap of faith.
  1. Evangelize continuously, relentlessly.
- Good product strategies have these principles in common:
  1. Focus on one target market or persona at a time.
  1. Aligned with business, sales, and go‐to‐market strategies.
  1. Obsess over customers, not over competitors.
  1. Communicate strategy across org.

- OKR Technique
- Objectives should be qualitative; key results need to be quantitative/measurable. Key results should be a measure of business results, not output or tasks. The rest of the company will use OKRs a bit differently, but for the PM, design, and tech org, focus on the org's objectives and the objectives for each product team, which are designed to roll up and achieve the org's objectives. Don't let personal objectives or functional team objectives dilute or confuse the focus. Find a good cadence for your org (typically, annually for an org's objectives and quarterly for a team's objectives).
- Keep the number of objectives and key results for the org and for each team small (one to three objectives, with one to three key results each is typical). It's critical that every product team track their active progress against their objectives (which is typically weekly). The objectives do not need to cover every little thing the team does, but they should cover what the team needs to accomplish. It's important that, one way or another, teams feel accountable to achieving their objectives. If they fail substantially, it's worth having a post‐mortem/retrospective with some of their peers or management. Agree as an org on how you will be evaluating or scoring your key results. There are different approaches to this, and it's in large part a reflection of your particular company culture. What's important here is consistency across the org, so that teams know when they can depend on one another. It's common to define a score of 0 (on a scale from 0 to 1.0) if you essentially make no progress, 0.3 if you just did the bare minimum—what you know you can achieve, 0.7 if you've accomplished more than the minimum and have really done what you'd hoped you would achieve, and 1.0 if you've really surprised yourselves and others with a truly exceptional result, beyond what people were even hoping for. Establish very clear and consistent ways to indicate when a key result is in reality a high‐integrity commitment (described earlier) rather than a normal objective. In other words, for most key results, you may be shooting for that 0.7 score. But for a high‐integrity commitment, these are special, and it's more binary. You either delivered what you promised or you didn't. Be very transparent (across the product and tech org) on what objectives each product team is working on and their current progress. Senior management (CEO and executive team) is responsible for the org's objectives and key results. The heads of product and tech are responsible for the product team objectives (and ensuring they deliver on the org's objectives). The individual product teams are responsible for proposing the key results for each objective they've been assigned. It is normal to have a give‐and‐take process each quarter as the OKRs are finalized for each team and for the org.
  Some highlights have been hidden or truncated due to export limits.
- If you deploy OKRs for your product org, the key is to focus your OKRs at the product team level. This means don't let functional team or individual person OKRs confuse the issue. Focus the attention of the individuals on their product team objectives. If different functional orgs (such as design, engineering, or quality assurance) have larger objectives (such as responsive design, technical debt, and test automation), they should be discussed and prioritized at the leadership team level along with the other business objectives, and then incorporated into the relevant product team's objectives.
- We have thus far discussed product vision, strategy, and business objectives. In truth, as an early stage startup, you can survive without any of these for a while. It's amazing how far you can get by focusing on meeting the needs of some early customers. However, the need for this vision and business‐objective context becomes truly serious at scale. Keeping a small number of teams and their engineers doing useful stuff is not very hard, but getting good results out of a medium—or, especially, large—organization can be truly challenging.
- There are several techniques to help communicate the value of what you're proposing to your team, colleagues, stakeholders, executives, and investors. Here are my top‐10 pieces of advice for PMs to sell the dream: Use a prototype.
- Share the pain. Show the team the customer pain you are addressing.
- Share the vision.
- Share learnings generously. After every user test or customer visit, share your learnings—not just the things that went well, but share the problems, too.
- Share credit generously. Make sure the team views it as their product, not just your product. However, when things don't go well, step forward and take responsibility
- Learn how to give a great demo. This is an especially important skill to use with customers and key execs. We're not trying to teach them how to operate the product, and we're not trying to do a user test on them. We're trying to show them the value of what we're building. A demo is not training, and it's not a test. It's a persuasive tool. Get really, really good at it.
- Do your homework. Your team and your stakeholders will all be much more likely to follow you if they believe you know what you're talking about. Be the undisputed expert on your users and customers. And be the undisputed expert on your market, including your competitors and the relevant trends.
- Be genuinely excited.
- Learn to show some enthusiasm.
- Spend time with your team.
- here's the key. If you want to discover great products, it really is essential that you get your ideas in front of real users and customers early and often.
- Principles of Product Discovery
- The purpose of product discovery is to address these critical risks: Will the customer buy this, or choose to use it? (Value risk) Can the user figure out how to use it? (Usability risk) Can we build it? (Feasibility risk) Does this solution work for our business? (Business viability risk) And it's not enough that it's just the PM's opinion on these questions. We need to collect evidence.
- We know we can't count on our customers (or our executives or stakeholders) to tell us what to build. Customers don't know what's possible, and with tech products, none of us know what we really want until we actually see it. It's not that customers or our executives are necessarily wrong; it's just that it's our job to make sure the solution we deliver solves the underlying problem. This is probably the most fundamental principle in all of modern product. Historically, in the vast majority of innovations in our industry, the customers had no idea that what they now love was even a possibility. This is only becoming truer with time.
- The most important thing is to establish compelling value. It's all hard, but the hardest part of all is creating the necessary value so that customers ultimately choose to buy or to use.
- As hard and important as the engineering is, coming up with a good user experience is usually even harder, and more critical to success.
- Functionality, design, and tech are inherently intertwined.
- We expect that many of our ideas won't work out, and the ones that do will require several iterations.
- we approach discovery with the mindset that many, if not most, of our ideas won't work out. The most common reason for this is value, but sometimes the design is too complicated, and sometimes it would take far too long to build, and sometimes there turn out to be legal or privacy issues.
- We must validate our ideas on real users and customers. One of the most common traps in product is to believe that we can anticipate our customer's actual response to our products. We might be basing that on actual customer research or on our own experiences, but in any case, we know today that we must validate our actual ideas on real users and customers. We need to do this before we spend the time and expense to build an actual product, and not after.
- Our goal in discovery is to validate our ideas the fastest, cheapest way possible. Discovery is about the need for speed. This lets us try out many ideas, and for the promising ideas, try out multiple approaches.
- We need to validate the feasibility of our ideas during discovery, not after. If the first time your developers see an idea is at sprint planning, you have failed.
- We need to validate the business viability of our ideas during discovery, not after. Similarly, it is absolutely critical to ensure that the solution we build will meet the needs of our business—before we take the time and expense to build out that product. Business viability includes financial considerations, marketing (both brand and go‐to‐market considerations), sales, legal, business development, and senior executives.
- It's about shared learning.
- teams competent in modern discovery techniques can generally test on the order of 10–20 iterations per week.
- Also, realize that many iterations never make it beyond just you, your designer, and your tech lead. The very act of creating a prototype often exposes problems that cause you to change your mind. As a rule of thumb, an iteration in discovery should be at least an order of magnitude less time and effort than an iteration in delivery.
- Much of our product discovery work doesn't require a lot of framing or planning. We need to come up with a solution to a particular problem, and often this is straightforward, and we can proceed directly to delivery work. But for many efforts, this is decidedly not the case, and some framing and true problem solving becomes critically important. Big projects—and, especially, initiatives (projects spanning multiple teams)—are common examples.
- The first is to ensure the team is all on the same page in terms of clarity of purpose and alignment. In particular, we need to agree on the business objective we're focused on, the specific problem we are intending to solve for our customers, which user or customers you're solving that problem for, and how you will know if you've succeeded. These should align directly to your product team's objectives and key results. The second purpose is to identify the big risks that will need to be tackled during the discovery work. I find that most teams tend to gravitate toward a particular type of risk that they are most comfortable with.
- Two examples I often find are teams that immediately proceed to tackling tech risks—especially performance or scale—and teams that zero in on usability risks. They know this change involves a complex workflow, and they're nervous about that, so they want to dive in right there. Those are both legitimate risks, but in my experience, they are generally the easier risks to tackle. We must also consider value risk—do the customers want this particular problem solved and is our proposed solution good enough to get people to switch from what they have now?
- Financial risk—can we afford this solution? Business development risk—does this solution work for our partners? Marketing risk—is this solution consistent with our brand? Sales risk—is this solution something our sales staff is equipped to sell? Legal risk—is this something we can do from a legal or compliance perspective? Ethical risk—is this solution something we should do?
- one of the most important lessons in our industry is to fall in love with the problem, not the solution. Why is this so important? Because, more often than not, our initial solutions don't solve the problem—at least not in a way that can power a successful business. It usually takes trying out several different approaches to a solution before we find one that solves the underlying problem.
- An opportunity assessment is an extremely simple technique but can save you a lot of time and grief. The idea is to answer four key questions about the discovery work you are about to undertake: What business objective is this work intended to address? (Objective) How will you know if you've succeeded? (Key results) What problem will this solve for our customers? (Customer problem) What type of customer are we focused on? (Target market)
- I believe the major risk facing most efforts is value risk. On a startup canvas, this shows up under solution risk—discovering a compelling solution to customers. A solution that your customers will choose to buy and use. This is generally hard enough but realize that to get someone to switch to our new product, it's not enough that it's comparable (sometimes referred to as feature parity), it must be demonstrably and substantially better. This is a high bar.
- Look, if you can discover a solution that your customers love, then you can tackle the risks of monetization and scale. However, without that solution, the rest of your work is very likely going to be wasted. So, whether your constrained resource is cash or management's patience, you need to make sure you primarily use your time to discover a winning solution. Get that risk resolved first and then you can focus on the other risks. The point is that you don't need to spend your time doing pricing optimization testing, sales tools, marketing programs, and cutting costs, until and unless you have discovered a truly valuable product.
- Story Map Technique
- These are two‐dimensional maps, in which major user activities are arrayed along the horizontal dimension, loosely ordered by time from left to right. So, if there are a dozen major user activities, they would be along the top from left to right, generally in the order you would do them—or at least, if you were describing the overall system to someone else, the order in which you'd describe them. Along the vertical dimension, we have a progressive level of detail. As we flesh out each major activity into sets of user tasks, we add stories for each of those tasks. The critical tasks are higher vertically than the optional tasks. If you lay out your system this way, you can, at a glance, get the holistic view and consider where to draw the line in terms of different releases and their associated objectives.
- Make no mistake about it: Everything depends on strong products.
- First, we need to talk about the nearly magical power of a happy reference customer.
- Let's be clear about what it means to be a reference customer: This is a real customer (not friends or family), who is running your product in production (not a trial or prototype), who has paid real money for the product (it wasn't given away to entice them to use it), and, most important, who is willing to tell others how much they love your product (voluntarily and sincerely).
- The reason I love the customer discovery program technique so much is because it is designed to produce these reference customers. We are discovering and developing a set of reference customers in parallel with discovering and developing the actual product. I will warn you that this technique takes substantial effort, primarily on the part of the PM. I wish it were easier. But I will also say that if you do this technique, I consider it the single best leading indicator of future product success.
- you would not do this program for small efforts like features or minor projects. This is for larger efforts. Good examples would be creating a new product or business, taking an existing product to a new market or new geography or a redesign of a product.
- The basic driver behind this technique is that, with a significant new product, the most common objection is that prospective customers want to see that other companies, like themselves, are already successfully using the product. They want to see the reference customers. In general, the more reference customers the better but too few, and the prospective customer is worried that the product is a special and only works for those one or two customers.
- For products and services aimed at businesses, I was taught years ago that the key number is six reference customers.
- Single Target Market Now these are not just any six customers. We are looking to develop six reference customers in our specific target market or segment, so, the idea is to find six similar customers. If you end up targeting two or three customers from two or three different markets, this program will not give you the focus you want and need.
- I do my best to persuade teams to not launch a product in the marketplace until after they have those six reference customers. We don't want to turn on the sales or marketing machine until we have evidence that we can help them be successful, and the reference customers are our best evidence.
- The concept behind this technique is to focus on developing this set of reference customers for a specific target market, which then makes it easy for sales to go after those specific types of customers. Once we have those reference customers for that initial target market, we can move on to expanding the product to meet the needs of the next target market.
- We are looking for prospective customers that truly feel the pain and are near desperate for the solution we want to build. If they could find a solution that worked for them elsewhere, they would have already bought it.
- We need them to have people and time willing to work closely with us. They need to be willing to spend time with the product team, testing out early prototypes and helping the team ensure the product works well for them. If possible, we would like them to be well‐recognized marquee names, because that will be of the most value to the sales and marketing staff.
- The benefit to the prospective customer is that they get real input, not lip service, to the solution—and, most important, they get a solution that truly works for them.
- Not everyone agrees with me on this, but I don't personally like the customer to pay in advance to participate in this program. That makes this a different type of relationship. You want a partner in coming up with the product. You do not want to build a custom solution just for them, and you're not a custom project shop. You can take their money after you deliver them a product they love. That said, if you're a very early stage startup with little cash, you may have to bend this rule just a bit. A compromise is to have them put the money into escrow.
- it's important that the members of the customer discovery program be the right set, and no more than eight. However, it's no problem also having an early release program that is essentially unlimited for those customers that want the software early,
- That said, if you find you are having real trouble recruiting even four or five prospective customers for this effort, then it's very possible you're chasing a problem that isn't that important, and you will almost certainly have a very hard time selling this product. This is one of the very first reality checks (aka demand validation) to make sure you're spending your time on something worthwhile. If customers aren't interested in this problem, you may want to rethink your plans.
- You need to make sure your customers are truly from your target market and not more than one target market. A big benefit of this program is focus, and that means the customers are from a single target market.
- One of the most common techniques for assessing product/market fit is known as the Sean Ellis test. This involves surveying your users (those in your target market that have used the product recently, at least a couple times, and you know from the analytics that they've at least made it through to the core value of the product) and asking them how they'd feel if they could no longer use this product. (The choices are "very disappointed," "somewhat disappointed," "don't care," and "no longer relevant because I no longer use."). The general rule of thumb is that if more than 40 percent of the users would be "very disappointed," then there's a good chance you're at product/market fit.
- While useful, as you might imagine there are lots of caveats here, depending on the type of product and the size of the sample. I like this test for consumer products and services, but for products for businesses, one of the reasons I like this customer discovery program so much is that I consider this a very practical and very effective definition of product/market fit. If we can get to the point where we have six reference customers in a specific target market, we will typically declare product/market fit for that market.
- So, each reference customer is a truly significant milestone. But, for example, getting six reference customers in a given target market for a B2B company is perhaps the most significant, meaningful milestone business result for a product org and something truly worth celebrating.
- The customer interview is the most basic technique I'll discuss in this book. I wish I didn't need to include it because I'd like to be able to take it for granted that PMs already know how to do this well and do it frequently.
- no question, this is one of the most powerful and important skills for any PM and very often the source or inspiration for many breakthrough product ideas.
- Here's what I'm always trying to understand: Are your customers who you think they are? Do they really have the problems you think they have? How does the customer solve this problem today? What would be required for them to switch?
- Here are some tips for getting the most out of these learning opportunities: Frequency. Establish a regular cadence of customer interviews. This should not be a once‐in‐a‐while thing. A bare minimum would be two to three hours of customer interviews per week, every week. Purpose. You are not trying to prove anything during these interviews, one way or the other. You're just trying to understand and learn quickly. This mindset is critical and needs to be sincere. Recruiting users and customers.
- Location. It's always amazing to see customers in their native habitat. There's so much to learn just by observing their environment. But it's also fine to meet them somewhere convenient or have them come to your office. If you need to do this over a video call, that's not as good, but much better than not doing at all. Preparation. Be clear beforehand what problem it is you think they have, and think about how you'll either confirm or contradict that. Who should attend. My favorite is to bring three people to these interviews: the PM, the product designer, and one of the engineers from the team (we normally rotate among those that want to attend). Usually, the designer drives (because they've usually been trained how to do this well), the PM takes notes, and the developer observes. Interview. Work to keep things natural and informal, ask open‐ended questions, and try to learn what they're doing today (not so much what they wish they were doing, although that's also interesting). Afterward. Debrief with your colleagues to see if you've all heard the same things and had the same learnings. If you made any promises to the customer during that session, be sure you keep them.
- It's critical to learn the answers to these key questions. However, I am a big fan of taking the opportunity of a customer interview to also try out some of our product ideas.
- Concierge Test Technique
- With this technique, you become the concierge. You do what the user or customer needs done for them. You may have to ask them to train you first, but you are in their shoes doing the tasks they would do.
- Like the principle of shared learning, it is most valuable if the PM, the product designer, and one of the engineers does the concierge test.
- allow, and even encourage, our customers to use our products to solve problems other than what we planned for and officially support.
- If you find your customers using your product in ways you didn't predict, this is potentially very valuable information. Dig in a little and learn what problem they are trying to solve and why they believe your product might provide the right foundation. Do this enough and you'll soon see patterns and, potentially, some very big product opportunities.
- The two main types of hack days are directed and undirected. In an undirected hack day, people can explore whatever product ideas they like, so long as it's at least loosely related to the mission of the company.
- In a directed hack day, there's a customer problem (for example, something is really difficult to learn and use, or it takes too long to do) or business objective we've been assigned (for example, "Reduce the customer churn rate" or "Increase customer lifetime value"), and we ask people from the product teams to self‐organize and work on any ideas they like that might address this objective.
- all forms of prototypes have certain characteristics and benefits in common. Here are five key principles behind their use. The overarching purpose of any form of prototype is to learn something at a much lower cost in terms of time and effort than building out a product. All forms of prototype should require at least an order of magnitude less time and effort as the eventual product. Realize that one of the key benefits of any form of prototype is to force you to think through a problem at a substantially deeper level than if we just talk about it or write something down. This is why the very act of creating a prototype so often exposes major issues otherwise left uncovered until much later. Similarly, a prototype is also a powerful tool for team collaboration. Members of the product team and business partners can all experience the prototype to develop shared understanding.
- There are many different possible levels of fidelity for a prototype. The fidelity primarily refers to how realistic the prototype looks. There is no such thing as one appropriate level of fidelity. Sometimes we don't need the prototype to look realistic at all, and other times it needs to be very realistic. The principle is that we create the right level of fidelity for its intended purpose, and we acknowledge that lower fidelity is faster and cheaper than higher fidelity, so we only do higher fidelity when we need to. The primary purpose of a prototype is to tackle one or more product risks (value, usability, feasibility, or viability) in discovery; however, in many cases, the prototype goes on to provide a second benefit, which is to communicate to the engineers and the broader org what needs to be built. This is often referred to as prototype as spec. In many cases, the prototype is sufficient for this, but in other cases—especially when the engineers are not co‐located or when the product is especially complex—the prototype will likely need to be supplemented with additional details (usually, use cases, business rules, and acceptance criteria).
- there are several situations wherein your engineers may identify a significant feasibility risk involved in solving a particular problem they are working on. Common examples include: Algorithm concerns Performance concerns Scalability concerns Fault tolerance concerns Use of a tech the team has not used before Use of a third‐party component or service the team has not used before Use of a legacy system the team has not used before Dependency on new or related changes by other teams
- A user prototype—one of the most powerful tools in product discovery—is a simulation. Smoke and mirrors. It's all a façade.
- The big limitation of a user prototype is that it's not good for proving anything—like whether or not your product will sell. Where a lot of novice product people go sideways is when they create a high‐fidelity user prototype and they put it in front of 10 or 15 people who all say how much they love it. They think they've validated their product, but unfortunately, that's not how it works. People say all kinds of things and then go do something different. We have much better techniques for validating value, so it's important that you understand what a user prototype is not appropriate for.
- we want to learn whether the user or customer really has the problems we think they have, and how they solve those problems today, and what it would take for them to switch. When you first start the actual usability test, make sure to tell your subject that this is just a prototype, it's a very early product idea, and it's not real. Explain that she won't be hurting your feelings by giving her candid feedback, good or bad. You're testing the ideas in the prototype, you're not testing her. She can't pass or fail—only the prototype can pass or fail.
- When testing, you'll want to do everything you can to keep your users in use mode and out of critique mode. What matters is whether users can easily do the tasks they need to do. It really doesn't matter if the user thinks something on the page is ugly or should be moved or changed. Sometimes misguided testers will ask users questions like "What three things on the page would you change?" To me, unless that user happens to be a product designer, I'm not really interested in that.
- During the testing, the main skill you have to learn is to keep quiet. When we see someone struggle, most of us have a natural urge to help the person out. You need to suppress that urge.
- There are three important cases you're looking for: (1) the user got through the task with no problem at all and no help; (2) the user struggled and moaned a bit, but he eventually got through it; or (3) he got so frustrated he gave up.
- In general, you'll want to avoid giving any help or leading the witness in any way. If you see the user scrolling the page up and down and clearly looking for something, it's okay to ask the user what specifically she's looking for, as that information is very valuable to you.
- Act like a parrot. This helps in many ways. First, it helps avoid leading. If they're quiet and you really can't stand it because you're uncomfortable, tell them what they're doing: "I see that you're looking at the list on the right." This will prompt them to tell you what they're trying to do, what they're looking for, or whatever it may be. If they ask a question, rather than giving a leading answer, you can play back the question to them. They ask, "Will clicking on this make a new entry?" and you ask in return, "You're wondering if clicking on this will make a new entry?" Usually, they will take it from there because they'll want to answer your question: "Yeah, I think it will." Parroting also helps avoid leading value judgments. If you have the urge to say, "Great!" instead you can say, "You created a new entry." Finally, parroting key points also helps your note taker because she has more time to write down important things.
- Testing Value
- We can't just assume there's demand, although often the demand is well established because most of the time our products are entering an existing market with demonstrated and measurable demand. The real challenge in that situation is whether we can come up with a demonstrably better solution in terms of value than the alternatives.
- The demand‐testing technique is called a fake door demand test. The idea is that we put the button or menu item into the user experience exactly where we believe it should be. But, when the user clicks that button, rather than taking the user to the new feature, it instead takes the user to a special page that explains that you are studying the possibility of adding this new feature, and you are seeking customers to talk to about this. The page also provides a way for the user to volunteer (by providing their e‐mail or phone number, for example).
- The same basic concept applies to entire products. Rather than a button on a page, we set up the landing page for the new offering's product funnel. This is called a landing page demand test. We describe that new offering exactly as we would if we were really launching the service. The difference is that if the user clicks the call to action, rather than signing up for the trial (or whatever the action might be), the user sees a page that explains that you are studying the possibility of adding this new offering, and you'd like to talk with them about that new offering if they're willing.
- If it's an expensive product for businesses—beyond what someone would put on a credit card—you can ask people if they will sign a "non‐binding letter of intent to buy" which is a good indicator that people are serious.
- Weaning an Organization Off Roadmaps
- every time you reference a product roadmap item, or discuss it in a presentation or meeting, be sure to include a reminder of the actual business outcome that feature is intended to help.
- If the feature you're working on is to add PayPal as a payment method, and the reason is to increase conversion, then be sure to always show the current conversion rate and the result you're hoping to achieve. Most important, after the feature goes live, be sure to highlight the impact on that conversion rate.
- The goal is that over time (it can take as long as a year), the org moves its focus from specific features launching on specific dates to business results.
