title: Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
date: 2020-12-31

- Blue/green deploy, roll forward
- Timeouts/deadlines for all remote calls
- Capped exponential backoff retries with jitter at single point in stack (only for idempotent calls based on response code, monitor retries)
- Well exercised fallbacks
- What happens when downstream services down? Gracefully degrade, timeouts (Postgres), circuit breakers (for all sync downstream calls via Resilience4j, which also does bulkheads and load shedding)
- For migrations, etc., two phase deploy with bake time, readers go before writers while rolling forward whereas writers go before readers while rolling backward
