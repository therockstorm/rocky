- Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck
  - Find the struggle that's right for you. What's worth struggling for? Say no to those that don't make you happy.
  - Measure success against proper values instead of comparing yourself to others.
  - Pleasure and material success are shitty. Worthwhile: based in reality, helpful to society, immediate and controllable effect. Honesty, creativity, generosity, humility.
  - Take full responsibility for life. You'd have a marathon if you were forced to do it. You're not a victim, take control.
  - People tend to flee things that threaten identity. More of a hindrance because you won't try for fear of failure. Use Buddhism to discover identity is an illusion.
  - Accept mistakes and insecurities. Ask whether you're wrong.
  - Humans are terrified of dying. We try to build legacy, causing stress. Don't give a fuck. Focus on here and now.
- Brain Rules
  - Exercise. Ancestors 10-20 km/day, feel and think better. Refreshes nuerons. Aerobic exercise, 30 minutes at a clip, 3 times/wk. Add a strengthening regimen and you get even more cognitive benefit. Exercise gets blood to your brain, bringing it glucose for energy and oxygen to soak up the toxic electrons that are left over. It also stimulates the protein that keeps neurons connecting.
  - Follow natural sleep cycle. Regenerates mind and body. Week of deprivation reduces by 60%.

- Me and my white supremacy
  - History of your race, in style clothes, easy to get legal and medical assistance, don't have to warn kids about racism. Even affects minority children.
  - White exceptionalism, you're not the victim and race has much more to do with things than you, as a white person, know
  - Tone policing of POC, both angry and "well-spoken"
  - Color blindness, tokenism, and white savior (the help movie)
  - Practice allyship. Act in support. Learn, educate others, support businesses, go to protests.
- Mindset
  - Fixed vs growth. Talent, natural aptitude vs practice and thirst for knowledge. Welcome problems.
  - Seek approval vs development.
  - Failures as disasters vs opportunities. About vs relish difficulties. Don't be afraid of embarrassment. Influenced by role models growing up. Anyone can adopt growth mindset.
- Atomic Habits
  - Small habits are powerful because of compounding. Change requires patience and confidence.
  - Habits are automated behaviors learned from experience. Queue, craving, response, reward.
  - Building new habits require hard to miss queues. Change surroundings to encourage good habits. Implemention intention to lay out specifics of doing something.
  - You're motivated by reward, make habits attractive. Desiring is sometimes as good as getting. Commit to only doing something you like while doing something good for you.
  - Make habit as easy to adopt as possible. Reduce friction for good, increase for bad. Commit to a 2 minute rule for food habits. Getting started is hardest. Build on momentum of existing habits with habit stacking.
  - Making habits immediately satisfying is key since habits are delayed return. E.g., open trip to Europe account to encourage less eating out.
  - Create framework to keep habits on track, either by tracking or negative consequences for not sticking to it. Make commitment with partner.
- The Antidote
  - Accept failure. Embrace death and suffering. Accepting stance toward negative thoughts. Control thoughts about situations. Confront fears head on, not as bad as you think. Observe state your in sitting negative situations, detach. Consider worst case scenario. Our beliefs about events are negative, not events themselves (like losing job ending up being good thing or even dying). Feelings are weather. Accept both bad and good and move on.

  - A wealth of intimacy lies beyond western romantic love. Lasting relationship are based on respect and appreciation of other person
  - Can cultivate spirituality without religion, leading to happier life. Goodness, compassion, and caring for one another.
  - Suffering is natural, but we often increase it unnecessarily. Attempt to eliminate the mental root cause instead of magnifying. Don't resist change and los. Don't replay negative past events.
  - Eliminate negative habits only through sustained effort. Positive emotions can be used to combat negative.
  - Shift perspectives to find the good. Sitting by fast farty person can teach patience and tolerance. Chance to become stronger. Must practice.

  - No avoidance, teach kids healthy ways to handle guilt and fear. Self reliance, teach kids what they need to flourish instead of trying to protect them.
  - Set strong boundaries to avoid entitlement. Praise effort, gratitude at dinner table, experiences of aw, clear hierarchy, follow through with consequences, rewards instead of bribes, united front with partner

- Tools of the Titans
  - "Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: ‘Is this the condition that I feared?’" —Seneca
  - "One of the many life skills that you want to learn at a fairly young age is the skill of being an ultra-thrifty, minimal kind of little wisp that’s traveling through time . . . in the sense of learning how little you actually need to live, not just in a survival mode, but in a contented mode. . . . That gives you the confidence to take a risk, because you say, ‘What’s the worst that can happen? Well, the worst that can happen is that I’d have a backpack and a sleeping bag, and I’d be eating oatmeal. And I’d be fine.’"
  - "It’s just an interesting little trick. For 28 days, when I met someone, whether it’s the lady at the DMV who’s making me wait 2 hours [or someone else], I would just assume everybody is doing the best they can with what they have, which is really hard for a lot of us to accept."
  - bad decisions make good stories.
  - Whitney and I both love Neil Gaiman’s "Make Good Art" commencement speech, which he gave at Philadelphia’s University of the Arts.
  - summarized dating in New York: "Everyone is too busy and everyone thinks they can do better.")
  - choose time over money, since you can always make more money. And I’ve always understood that the best investment of my limited time on earth is to spend it with people I love.
  - You can’t reason someone out of something they didn’t reason themselves into.
  - "Trying to get everyone to like you is a sign of mediocrity. You’ll avoid the tough decisions, and you’ll avoid confronting the people who need to be confronted."—Colin Powell
  - "If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid."—Epictetus
  - "Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want."
  - Anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at someone else (Buddhist saying).
  - Praise specifically, criticize generally (Warren Buffett).
  - "What you choose to work on, and who you choose to work with, are far more important than how hard you work."
  - ‘There are no adults.’ Everyone’s making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it."
  - "This universe has been around for probably 10 billion years or more, and will be around for tens of billion years afterwards. So your existence, my existence, is just infinitesimal. It is like a firefly blinking once in the night. Nothing that we do lasts. Eventually you will fade, your works will fade, your children will fade, your thoughts will fade, this planet will fade, the sun will fade . . . it will all be gone. "There are entire civilizations that we remember now with just one or two words like ‘Sumerian’ or ‘Mayan.’ Do you know any Sumerians or Mayans? Do you hold any of them in high regard or esteem? Have they outlived their natural lifespan somehow? No. "If you don’t believe in an afterlife, then you [should realize] that this is such a short and precious life, it is really important that you don’t spend it being unhappy. There is no excuse for spending most of your life in misery. You’ve only got 70 years out of the 50 billion or however long the universe is going to be around."
  - Am I so inspired by what I learned during the day that I want to be talking about it at 1:00 in the morning? And do I have someone who will have that conversation with me and who will challenge me? That’s it. Everything else is nonsense."
  - "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect."—Mark Twain
  - "What should we simplify?"
  - Are you spending all your time and exhausting all your energy catching field mice? In the short term it might give you a nice, rewarding feeling. But in the long run you’re going to die. So ask yourself at the end of the day, "Did I spend today chasing mice or hunting antelope?"
  - "Which one of these, if done, would render all the rest either easier or completely irrelevant?"
  - "What would this look like if it were easy?"
  - "If you’ve got enough money to solve the problem, you don’t have the problem."
  - I routinely write "No hurry, no pause" at the top of my notebooks as a daily reminder. In effect, it’s shorthand for Derek Sivers’s story of the 45-minute versus 43-minute bike ride (page 190)—you don’t need to go through life huffing and puffing, straining and red-faced. You can get 95% of the results you want by calmly putting one foot in front of the other. One former Navy SEAL friend recently texted me a principle used in their training: "Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast." Perhaps I’m just getting old, but my definition of luxury has changed over time. Now, it’s not about owning a lot of stuff. Luxury, to me, is feeling unrushed. No hurry, no pause.
