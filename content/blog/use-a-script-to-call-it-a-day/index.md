title: Use a Script to Call It a Day
description: Ending the day can be tough, especially when you work from home. Script it so you can make one decision instead of many.

One of the cons of working from home is deciding when enough is enough. Itâ€™s all too easy to get into a problem, lose track of time, and let hours slip away.

I find that even after I decide to close my text editor, I see messages in Slack I should read. I close this window and notice unread emails in my inbox. I came up with a simple solution, create a script that closes all work-related applications,

```
pgrep com.docker.hyperkit && docker-compose down
osascript -e 'quit app "Docker"'
osascript -e 'quit app "Slack"'
osascript -e 'quit app "Google Chrome"'
osascript -e 'quit app "iTerm"'
```

I alias this in `~/.zshrc` with `alias down=~/dev/down.sh` so at the end of the day, I decide once that I'm done and run `down`. The next morning, I run `up`,

```
open -a Slack
open -a Docker
open -a "Google Chrome"
```

If you've created similar scripts, let me know what I'm missing in mine, [@therockstorm](https://twitter.com/therockstorm).
