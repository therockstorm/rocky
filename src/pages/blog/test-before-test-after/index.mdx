By now, I hope we can all agree that unit tests are a good idea. I recently gave a presentation on why I think testing before writing production code (TDD) is better than testing after.

## Code Quality

Only writing code to fix failing tests yields:

- Better tests
- Testable code
  - Decoupled
  - Fast
- Less rework
- High test coverage
  - Less debugger
- Simple
  - Less gold-plating

## Continuous Integration

Minimizing time in Red and committing on Green yields:

- Compiling, tested code every ~10 minutes
- Ability to revert to last Green quickly

## Improved Interfaces

Intelligent test names and coding from client's perspective yields

- Self-documenting code with clean, natural interfaces

```csharp
// 👎
GetLog().Debug().Message("My message.");
Log(Priority.Debug, "My message.");
```

```csharp
// 👍
void Debug_LogsDebugMessage() {
   Log.Debug("My message.");
   // Some assert
}
```

Testing after is work, TDD is fun!
