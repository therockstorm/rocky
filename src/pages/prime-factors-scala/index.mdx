I like running through the Prime Factors Kata when learning a new language to help uncover the language's power. I've done this before in [Clojure](./prime-factors-clojure) and now it's Scala's turn. Scala is interesting in that it attempts to merge the best aspects of both object-oriented and functional languages.

The steps I took follow. Each is separated by a horizontal line with changes from the previous iteration in red. The factors of four caused modifications to the algorithm that allowed the next two tests to pass without further changes. It was test-driven using [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/).

```scala
test("Factor of one is empty list") {
  assert(List[Int]() === primeFactors(1))
}
```

```scala
def primeFactors(n: Int) = {
  List[Int]()
}
```

---

```scala
test("Factor of two is two") {
  assert(List(2) === primeFactors(2))
}
```

```scala
def primeFactors(n: Int) = {
  if (n > 1) {
    List(2)
  } else {
    List[Int]()
  }
}
```

---

```scala
test("Factor of three is three") {
  assert(List(3) === primeFactors(3))
}
```

```scala
def primeFactors(n: Int) = {
  if (n > 1) {
    List(n)
  } else {
    List[Int]()
  }
}
```

---

```scala
test("Factors of four are two and two") {
  assert(List(2, 2) === primeFactors(4))
}
```

```scala
def primeFactors(n: Int) = {
  def primeFactors(n: Int, candidate: Int): List[Int] =
    if (n <= 1) List[Int]()
    else if (n % candidate == 0) candidate :: primeFactors(n / candidate, candidate)
    else List(n)

  primeFactors(n, 2)
}
```

---

```scala
test("Factors of six are two and three") {
  assert(List(2, 3) === primeFactors(6))
}
```

---

```scala
test("Factors of eight are two, two, and two") {
  assert(List(2, 2, 2) === primeFactors(8))
}
```

---

```scala
test("Factors of nine are three and three") {
  assert(List(3, 3) === primeFactors(9))
}
```

```scala
def primeFactors(n: Int) = {
  def primeFactors(n: Int, candidate: Int): List[Int] =
    if (n <= 1) List[Int]()
    else if (n % candidate == 0) candidate :: primeFactors(n / candidate, candidate)
    else primeFactors(n, candidate + 1)

  primeFactors(n, 2)
}
```

The end result is the last code snippet and all the tests.

However, as I mentioned above, Scala is a unique language that allows both imperative and functional styles. Though the functional style is preferred, in the spirit of completeness, I thought I'd show what the end result would look like imperatively.

```scala
def primeFactors(n: Int) = {
  var primes = List[Int]()
  var candidate = 2;
  var x = n

  while (x > 1) {
    while (x % candidate == 0) {
      primes = candidate :: primes
      x /= candidate
    }
    candidate += 1
  }

  primes
}
```

As you can see, the imperative version isn't as clean and forced me to create a local variable so I could mutate it. The nice thing about Scala, though, is that it lets you slowly dip your toe into a different programming paradigm instead of jumping in head first.
