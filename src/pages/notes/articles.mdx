# [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

Paul Graham discusses the conflict between "maker's" and "manager's" schedules. Makers, like programmers and writers, need long, uninterrupted blocks of time to be productive, whereas managers operate on schedules filled with hourly appointments. Graham suggests that understanding and respecting these different needs can mitigate scheduling conflicts, proposing solutions like setting aside "office hours" for meetings. This approach allows makers to maintain productivity while accommodating necessary meetings.

# [Stepping Stones not Milestones](https://medium.com/@jamesacowling/stepping-stones-not-milestones-e6be0073563f)

Successfully delivering on long-term engineering projects often involves structuring them around "stepping stones" rather than arbitrary milestones. Stepping stones are defined as coherent, tangible deliverables that provide real value and illuminate "unknown unknowns," helping teams navigate the complexities of large projects without succumbing to common pitfalls such as over-engineering or excessive resource allocation. This approach contrasts with traditional milestone-based planning, which may not effectively de-risk projects or contribute to the discovery and resolution of unforeseen challenges.

The concept emphasizes the importance of recognizing known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns in project management, advocating for a strategy that involves incremental discovery and problem-solving. The strategy for navigating a project is likened to a cone, where the path is not a straight line but a guided exploration within a defined strategy space. Each stepping stone within this strategy should deliver a simplified yet valuable version of the final system, allow for learning and adaptation, and remain aligned with the overarching project goals.

Effective use of stepping stones involves creating deliverables that are not just checkpoints but opportunities for reevaluation and progress, offering practical benefits at every stage. This approach not only facilitates a more flexible and responsive project management strategy but also ensures that even if a project is redirected or canceled, the work completed still provides value.

In summary, the stepping stone approach to project management offers a nuanced framework for navigating the complexities of engineering projects. It emphasizes the need for a balance between planning and adaptability, encouraging a focus on simplicity, strategic alignment, and the continuous delivery of value.
