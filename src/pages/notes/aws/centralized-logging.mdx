- Send all logs to centralized logging AWS account so as number of accounts grow, only one need be forwarded to, e.g., Splunk, Datadog, etc.
- Define log retention policy backed by lifecycle policies
- If configured via S3 bucket, add aws:SourceArn condition key to limit access to only your other account resources
