<Figure caption="AWS VPC Diagram" src={vpcDiagram} />

- Logical data center within AWS
- Consist of Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateway (IGW, limit one per VPC), NAT Gateway, VPC Endpoints, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), and Security Groups (cannot span VPCs)
- By default, creating VPCs in console creates Route Table, NACL, and Security Group
- Peering
  - Works cross-region
  - IPv4 CIDR blocks cannot overlap
  - Does not act like a Transit VPC (aka cannot transitively peer VPCs)
- AZs are randomly assigned letters, `us-west-2a` in one account isn't necessarily the same as `us-west-2a` in another
- Subnets
  - AWS reserves first four and last IP addresses in each subnet CIDR block
  - Each must be associated with only one NACL, defaults to default NACL
- NACLs
  - Basically a firewall, whereas security groups work at instance level, NACLs work at subnet level
  - Each subnet must be associated with only one NACL, defaults to default NACL
  - Default NACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic
  - Stateless, responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to outbound rules and vice versa
  - Since client chooses ephemeral port when initiating connection, NACLs must allow traffic on appropriate ports in outbound rules
  - List of inbound and outbound allow and deny rules evaluated in order starting with lowest number, as soon as rule matches, it applies and remaining rules aren't checked
  - Put deny rules first
  - Default created with VPC allows all in and outbound traffic
  - Newly created disallow all in and outbound traffic
  - Can block specific IPs, unlike Security Groups
  - Entry max default 20, can be increased up to 40
- NATs
  - Provide internet traffic to instances in private subnets
  - Prefer Gateways to Instances for management and scaling benefits
  - Create in multiple AZs for high availability
  - Must be in public subnet with private subnet route to corresponding NAT
  - Must disable source/destination checks on Instances and increase instance size for performance
- Bastion Host/Jump Box/Proxy Server
  - Provide SSH and RDP connections to instances in private subnet
  - Must be in public subnet
  - SSH agent forwarding allows users to use their local SSH keys to connect to instances in private subnet, SSH keys remain on user workstation
- VPC Endpoints
  - Provide private subnet connections to AWS services and PrivateLink services without leaving AWS network
  - Horizontally scaled, highly-available virtual devices
  - Interface, Gateway (S3 and DynamoDB), and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints
  - Gateway endpoint (1st gen)
    - Sits outside VPC, must have route in route table where target is endpoint
    - Cannot use directly from VPNs or Direct Connect
    - Only supports same region access and IPv4 traffic
    - Must enable DNS resolution in VPC
    - Can use endpoint policies to control access
    - If you get AccessDenied, check instance, endpoint, and bucket policies
  - Interface endpoint (2nd gen)
    - ENI with private IP from IP range of your subnet
    - Can use security groups to control access and also have endpoint policies
  - Service VPC endpoints
    - For things like Datadog, Splunk, etc.
    - Endpoint in service consumer sends to load balancer in service provider, sent over AWS private network
  - Doesn't go over internet, reducing data transfer costs and latency, improving security via E2E encryption, and preventing internet gateway bottlenecks
- Flow Logs
  - Records traffic visiting resources and resource outbound connection details
  - Not real-time, every few minutes
  - Cannot enable across accounts
  - Cannot change configuration after creation
  - Format
    - Version
    - Account ID
    - Interface ID
    - Source IP
    - Destination IP
    - Source Port
    - Destination Port
    - Protocol
    - Packets
    - Bytes
    - Start Time
    - End Time
    - Action
    - Log Status
  - Not monitored: traffic to reserved IPs, instance metadata to and from 169.254.169.254, Amazon DNS, Amazon Windows license activation, and DHCP
- DNS
  - `enableDnsHostnames`: Indicates whether instances with public IPs get public DNS hostnames
  - `enableDnsSupport`: Indicates whether DNS resolution is supported through Amazon-provided DNS server
- Direct Connect
  - Connects your data center to AWS for high-throughput and/or reliable connections
