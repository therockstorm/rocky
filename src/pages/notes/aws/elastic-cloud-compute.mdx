- Pricing models
  - On-Demand: fixed-rate by hour or second, no commitments
  - Spot: bid on spare compute for up to 90% off On-Demand prices, can be interrupted
  - Reserved: capacity reservation for one to three year term providing up to 75% off On-Demand prices
  - Dedicated Hosts: physical server dedicated to you, useful for server-bound licenses, purchased On-Demand or Reserved
  - [Comparison site](https://ec2.shop/)
- Tenancy
  - Shared: EC2 VM launched on shared, multi-tenant hardware, noisy neighbor potential
  - Dedicated instance: single customer hardware, but may be running multiple EC2 VMs, starting and stopping may start on different server
  - Dedicated host: Single customer, single server
- Instance Store volumes are ephemeral, they can be restarted, but cannot be stopped, will lose data if the underlying host fails, and cannot be kept after termination. Prefer EBS.
- Security Groups
  - By default, all inbound traffic is blocked and all outbound traffic is allowed
  - They are stateful, if you send a request from your instance, response traffic for request is allowed regardless of inbound rules. Similarly, responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules.
  - Only support allow rules, not deny
  - Existing connections aren't affected by rule changes, only new ones (unlike NACLs, which take effect immediately)
  - IP entries max default 300, can be increased to 1000
- Instance metadata available at [http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/](http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/) and user data at [http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/](http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/)
  - Can be accessed within instance itself
  - ami-id, hostname, iam, instance-type, mac, profile, public-keys, security-groups, etc.
  - When roles are associated with EC2 instance, a set of temporary credentials are made available via the instance metadata service
    - Can block access with instance-level firewalls like iptables or simply don't allow instance access to those that don't need it
- Placement Groups
  - Clustered: low latency and high throughput networking, each is in close proximity in the same AZ
  - Spread: individual critical instances, each is on separate racks and can be multi-AZ
  - Partitioned: large distributed and replicated workloads with multiple instances, each partition is on separate racks and can be multi-AZ
- Networking
  - Elastic Network Interface (ENI) for basic networking
  - Enhanced Network Adapter (ENA) for speeds between 10 and 100 Gbps
  - Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning (ML), or OS bypass
- Key pairs
  - Key pairs are added at instance creation to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  - Deleting the key pair from the AWS console does **not** delete it from the instance
  - Creating an AMI of an instance that has a key and launching a new instance using that AMI and a new key pair, the new will append to `authorized_keys`
  - Manual process to remove keys from `authorized_keys` file of each instance where it exists

## Elastic Block Store (EBS)

- Uses network attached storage (NAT)
- Options to nullify data
  - Wipe data prior to instance termination using, e.g., `dd`
  - AWS wipes data immediately before EBS is reused
  - At drive EOL, AWS decommissions via NIST 800-88 or DoD 5220.22-M
- By default, root volumes are deleted when the instance is terminated but additional volumes are not
- Always in the same availability zone (AZ) as the running instance
- Volume Types
  - SSD
    - General Purpose (gp2), balances price and performance, max 16,000 IOPS
    - Provisioned IOPS (io1), high performance designed for databases
  - HDD
    - Throughput Optimized (st1), frequently accessed big data, data warehouses, and log processing
    - Cold (sc1), lowest cost for less frequency accessed data
- Snapshots
  - Preferably taken on stopped instances, but not required
  - Stored on S3 and incremental, only blocks changed since last snapshot are saved
  - Automatically encrypted if volume is encrypted
  - Can only share snapshots with other accounts or make public if unencrypted
- To move a volume from one AZ or Region to another
  1. Create a snapshot
  2. If unencrypted, optionally copy snapshot as encrypted
  3. Create an AMI from the snapshot
  4. If moving to a new region, copy AMI to desired region
  5. Use the AMI to launch an instance in desired AZ

## Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

- Use to distribute traffic across multiple targets in a single and across multiple AZs (if enabled)
- Tight integration with Auto Scaling, WAF, ACM, etc.
- To use in a VPC, need a minimum of two public subnets
- 504 means there's likely an issue with your application
- Instance health checks are shown as either `InService` or `OutOfService`
- Get client IP using `X-Forwarded-For` header
- Types
  - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    - Application layer 7, allowing for, e.g., path, query string, header, request method, etc. based routing
    - Preferred for most applications
    - Given DNS name, not IP
  - Network Load Balancer (NLB)
    - Transport layer 4
    - High performance (millions of requests per second)
    - Can assign a static IP
    - Cannot associate security group with them
    - Primarily selects target using flow hash algorithm based on protocol, source IP and port, destination IP and port, and TCP sequence number
    - Each individual TCP connection is routed to a single target for the life of the connection
  - Gateway Load Balancer
    - Network layer 3 and Transport layer 4
    - Deploy, scale, and manage virtual appliances, e.g., firewalls, IDS, IPS, etc.
  - Classic Load Balancer
    - Lower cost, legacy solution
    - Given DNS name, not IP
- Listener is process that checks for connection requests using the protocol and port you configure
  - Contains listener rules for which action (forward to, redirect to, or return fixed response) to take based on request
  - Can forward to target groups
- Target group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets (instances, Lambdas, etc.)
- Access logs list all requests
  - Disabled by default
  - Pushes logs to S3 every 5 minutes
  - Logs on best-effort basis
  - Bucket and ELB must be in same region
  - Bucket policy must allow ELB **AWS account** to write to it, varies by region and is available in documentation
