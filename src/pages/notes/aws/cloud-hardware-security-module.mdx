- Physical tamper-resistant device providing extra security for sensitive data
- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified
- Used to provision cryptographic keys
- Requires VPC
- Separation of duties is inherent in CloudHSM design, AWS monitors health and network availability but is not involved in creation and management of key material
- AWS load balances requests and distributes keys across other HSMs in cluster
  - Recommend at least two HSMs across multiple AZs
- Single tenant
- Can integrate with RedShift & RDS for Oracle, etc.
- Benefits over KMS
  - Dedicated, 3rd-party validated HSM under your exclusive control (AWS cannot administer keys)
  - Integration with applications using PKCS#11, JCE, CNG, and other standards
  - High-performance in-VPC cryptographic acceleration (bulk crypto)
  - Organization admin can export and share keys as needed
