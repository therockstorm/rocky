- gRPC
  - Get the server IP, with it,
    - Use BloomRPC or Insomnia to hit service directly
    - SSH into instance and run `netcat` against the port, `nc -zv [localhost](http://localhost)6565`
    - Hit the admin port and its health check
    - If all else fails, add a bunch of logging
- IntelliJ
  - `sbt clean`
  - Build > Rebuild Project (required sometimes because running `sbt` on the command line steps on IntelliJ cache)
  - File > Invalidate Caches > Restart
  - Close IntelliJ, delete `.idea` folder, and re-import project
  - Nuclear option: **make sure all changes are committed**, close IntelliJ, run `git clean -xdf` (deletes everything not in the `git` index), and re-import project
