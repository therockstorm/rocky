# Productivity and time management

## [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

Paul Graham discusses the conflict between "maker's" and "manager's" schedules. Makers, like programmers and writers, need long, uninterrupted blocks of time to be productive, whereas managers operate on schedules filled with hourly appointments. Graham suggests that understanding and respecting these different needs can mitigate scheduling conflicts, proposing solutions like setting aside "office hours" for meetings. This approach allows makers to maintain productivity while accommodating necessary meetings.

## [Stepping Stones not Milestones](https://medium.com/@jamesacowling/stepping-stones-not-milestones-e6be0073563f)

Successfully delivering on long-term engineering projects often involves structuring them around "stepping stones" rather than arbitrary milestones. Stepping stones are defined as coherent, tangible deliverables that provide real value and illuminate "unknown unknowns," helping teams navigate the complexities of large projects without succumbing to common pitfalls such as over-engineering or excessive resource allocation. This approach contrasts with traditional milestone-based planning, which may not effectively de-risk projects or contribute to the discovery and resolution of unforeseen challenges. Each stepping stone within this strategy should deliver a simplified yet valuable version of the final system, allow for learning and adaptation, and remain aligned with the overarching project goals.
