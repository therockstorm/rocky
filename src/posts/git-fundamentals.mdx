Git can seem overwhelming, but while performing typical day-to-day tasks, you'll use only about ten commands. If you happen to use [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/), the included [`git` plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) adds many [aliases](./linux-bash-aliases). Below each command, I've included the corresponding alias.

```shell
# Start a new branch for a new feature
git checkout -b new-feature
gcb new-feature

# Commit as you make changes (the --all adds changed files to
# `staging`)
git commit --all --message "your commit message"
gcam "your commit message"

# Add new or deleted files to `staging` (the `git commit
# --all` above only adds tracked files)
git add --all
gaa

# Check the status of your branch/commits
git status
gst

# Switch branches
git checkout branch-name
gco branch-name
# Separate `git` plugin alias to switch back to master
gcm

# See what has changed (maybe done prior to committing, include
# the `--cached` flag to see what has changed in `staging`)
git diff
gd

# Pull new changes down from remote (Github/GitLab/etc.)
git pull
gl

# Push changes to remote
git push --set-upstream origin
gpsup

# Merge changes from another branch into the current one
git merge other-branch-name
gm other-branch-name

# Or, if you prefer rebase,
git rebase -i other-branch-name
grbi other-branch-name
```

And that's it! 95% of the time, you'll use these commands. Google was invented for the remaining 5% ðŸ˜‰
