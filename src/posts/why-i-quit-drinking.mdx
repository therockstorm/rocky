<Figure id="beer" />

I love beer. However, on my son's first birthday, I stopped drinking with the goal of reassessing after four months. I get asked why a lot.

After having a couple beers, I don't feel like doing anything productive. I usually drink a couple times a week. If I have my first beer at 4 and drink or am drunk until bed, that's about 15 hours/wk where I'm not reading, working out, or driving anywhere.

It affects my health, ambition, patience, memory, sleep, and bank account. Without it, I feel like I have super powers. In the two months since I stopped, I've dropped to my high school weight, am learning to swim to train for a triathlon, started lifting again, signed up for [RAGBRAI](https://ragbrai.com/), and received two industry certifications.

I may drink again, I may not. So far, though, the benefits of sobriety seem to be far outweighing my love for beer.
