## Incident response

- Key compromise
  - Determine access associated with exposed key
  - Make keys inactive
  - Add explicit deny policy to IAM principal
  - Review logs for possible backdoor
- EC2 compromise
  - Isolate instance through security group
  - Take EBS snapshot and memory dump
  - Perform forensics analysis
- GuardDuty
  - Allow IPs to avoid unnecessary alerts during penetration testing
  - Supports VPC flow, CloudTrail (including `CloudTrailLoggingDisabled`), and Route53 DNS logs
  - If using 3rd party DNS resolver, GuardDuty does not process this data
- [Penetration tests](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/)
  - Allowed without prior approval for nine services: EC2 (including NAT and ELB), RDS, CloudFront,Aurora, API Gateway, Fargate, Lambda, Lightsail, and Elastic Beanstalk
  - May see older questions about "Pre-authorized scanning engine from marketplace"
- Abuse notice
  - Received if workload is being used for non-AUP conforming purposes
- Stolen laptop use-case: modify `authorized_key` file of all EC2 instances
- CloudTrail stores 90 days in console. After that, can use Athena to query S3.

## Logging and monitoring

- VPC flow log format
- Inspector scans target based on tag key-value pair
  - Uses supported baselines, e.g., CVE, CIS, best practices, network reachability, etc.
  - Some, like CVE, require Inspector agent
- Systems manager
  - Run command
  - Patch compliance: check instance compliance status
  - Patch baseline: which patches are needed, define approval
  - Maintenance window
  - Parameter store: prefer `SecureString`, uses KMS
- Config records config changes and provides compliance rule sets, integrated with Lambda for auto-remediation
  - Audit IAM policies before/after Incident
  - Detect CloudTrail disabled
  - Verify instances are using specific AMI
  - Detect security group rules on specific ports
  - Detect internet gateway addition to non-authorized VPC
  - Detect EBS volume encryption
- WAF is layer 7, integrates with ALB, CloudFront, and API Gateway
- CloudWatch logs can centrally store server and application logs
  1. Assign IAM role to instance allowing CloudWatch push
  1. Install CloudWatch Agent
  1. Configure appropriate config to start agent
  - To troubleshoot, verify `awslogs` service is running manually or via Run Command and verify IAM policy
  - Metric filters used to identify errors
  - Alarms can be sent after metrics reach threshold
- IP packet inspection achieved at VPC level with all outbound traffic sent to proxy server or at host level with appropriate agent, not with flow logs
- CloudTrail
  - Enable for all regions and store data centrally
    1.  Create S3 bucket in central account
    1.  Configure CloudTrail in all accounts to push logs to central account
  - To update log prefix, first modify S3 bucket policy and then update trail

## Infrastructure security

- DDoS mitigation: Shield, CloudFront, Auto-Scaling, Route53, WAF, CloudWatch
- Direct Connect
  - Region-specific outside of US, dedicated connection between data center and AWS
  - Not encrypted, use VPN tunneling if required
- CloudFront
  - Signed URLs: real-time messaging protocol (RTMP) (cookies not supported), restrict access to specific files, users are using client without cookie support
  - Signed cookies: multiple restricted files
  - Supports custom TLS certificates in PEM format, must be imported into US East (N. Virginia) region, key length cannot exceed 2048 bits
- VPC endpoints
  - Can use to allow only specific S3 buckets within account
  - Can use with KMS and `aws:sourceVpc` condition key to allow only specific VPCs to access KMS and ensure private DNS is enabled
- Network ACL
  - Stateless, works at subnet level, max 40 rules with default of 20. If you need more, use, e.g., iptables
- URL allowlist, e.g., "server should only access URL related to package updates", enabled via AWS Marketplace custom proxy like Squid
- SES
  - TLS for encrypted SMTP connection, ports 25, 587, and 2587
- Can disable instances from using Amazon-provided DNS by disabling DNS resolution in VPC
- Can use host-based IDS for file integrity, integrate with CloudWatch for alerting
- For IPS, install agent on instance and report to central SIEM server

## Identity and access management

- Cross-account IAM role troubleshooting
  1. Verify `sts:AssumeRole` granted
  1. Verify appropriate RoleArn is added
  1. Verify external ID
- VPN used for remote employees to connect to private VPC resources, can use VPN appliance from AWS Marketplace like OpenVPN
- When integrating AD, DNS should point to AD
- SCPs can only restrict access, impact root user as well
- Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) is a Microsoft SSO solution
  - Supports SAML, AD groups are associated/mapped with IAM roles where all users in group can assume role
  - In AD, direction of trust is opposite direction of access
- IAM role can be used across multiple services by modifying trust policy

## Data protection

- ACM is regional, must be in same region as ELB and in US East (N. Virginia) for CloudFront
  - Cannot export public certificates created by ACM but can export private certificates
- AWS uses SafeNet Luna SA 700 HSA CloudHSM, tamper-evident
- CloudTrail logs are server-side encrypted by default in S3, can optionally use SSE-KMS
- KMS
  - Automated rotation works for AWS KMS generated key material, cannot be used for imported key material, you must manually rotate them. You can do this by creating a new CMK and mapping an existing key alias to it.
  - For cross-region imported CMKs, you can re-wrap the data encryption key from the source region using the CMK
  - If you accidentally delete imported CMK, download a new wrapping key and import key into existing CMK
- ELB
  - If app is using custom protocol, use TCP instead of HTTP(S) listeners
  - Supports Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), need to enable ECDHE key exchange
- Glacier Vault lock can be aborted when InProgress
- For user to start instance with encrypted EBS, must have `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:CreateGrant` permissions
- Enabling Secrets Manager rotation causes immediate rotation
- Parameter store SecretString troubleshooting
  - Application must have permission to access CMK
  - CMK is not found because of, e.g., incorrect identifier
  - CMK is not enabled resulting in `InvalidKeyId` exception

## Misc

- Can specify which API operations users are allowed to call in IAM policies and enforce MFA
- Docker security
  - Can limit resource consumption (CPU, memory), networking connections, ports, and unnecessary container libraries
  - Can segregate containers by host, function, and data classification
- CloudHSM
  - Can integrate with KSM via custom key store feature
  - Allows immediate deletion of key material (rather than waiting seven days)
  - Allows key usage audits independently of KMS and CloudTrail
