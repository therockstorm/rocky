<Figure caption="" id="vpc-diagram" />

- Logical datacenter within AWS
- Consist of Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateway (IGW, limit one per VPC), NAT Gateway, VPC Endpoints, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), and Security Groups (cannot span VPCs)
- By default, creating VPCs in console creates Route Table, NACL, and Security Group
- Cannot transitively peer VPCs
- AZs are randomly assigned letters, `us-west-2a` in one account isn't necessarily the same as `us-west-2a` in another
- Subnets
  - AWS reserves first four and last IP addresses in each subnet CIDR block
  - Each must be associated with only one NACL, defaults to default NACL
- NACLs
  - Stateless, responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to outbound rules and vice versa
  - List of inbound and outbound allow and deny rules evaluated in order starting with lowest number, put deny rules first
  - Default created with VPC allows all in and outbound traffic
  - Newly created disallow all in and outbound traffic
  - Can block specific IPs, unlike Security Groups
- NATs
  - Provide internet traffic to instances in private subnets
  - Prefer Gateways to Instances for management and scaling benefits
  - Create in multiple AZs for high availability
  - Must be in public subnet with private subnet route to cooresponding NAT
  - Must disable source/destination checks on Instances and increase instance size for performance
- Bastion Host/Jump Box
  - Provide SSH and RDP connections to instances in private subnet
  - Must be in public subnet
- VPC Endpoints
  - Provide private subnet connections to AWS services and PrivateLink services without leaving AWS network
  - Horizontally scaled, highly-available virtual devices
  - Interface and Gateway Endpoints (S3 and DynamoDB)
- Flow Logs
  - Cannot enable across accounts
  - Cannot change configuration after creation
  - Traffic to reserved IPs, 169.354.169.254, Amazon DNS, Amazon Windows license activation, and DHCP is not monitored
- Direct Connect
  - Connects your datacenter to AWS for high-throughput and/or reliable connections
