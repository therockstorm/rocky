- Use to route traffic between AWS regions
- Alias records provide Route 53-specific extension to DNS allowing you to route traffic to selected AWS resources such as S3 buckets
- Routing Policies
  - Simple: use for single resource, e.g., web server serving content for example.com. If multiple IPs are provided, Route 53 returns them in random order.
  - Failover: use for active-passive failover, if health checks fail in one region, traffic is routed to healthy region
  - Geolocation: route traffic based on location of users
  - Geoproximity: route traffic based on location of resources and optionally shift traffic using biases from resources in one location to another
  - Latency: route traffic to resources in region providing best latency
  - Multi-value: Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random
  - Weighted: route traffic to multiple resources in proportions you specify
- Query logs
  - Records each connection from client devices to domain
  - DNS typically isn't monitored, so is a target for exfiltration attacks
- Supports DNSSEC, which adds digital signatures to DNS records to verify authenticity, prevents DNS spoofing aka cache poisoning
  - Disadvantages including added complexity, limited TLD and DNS server support, and increased DNS query resolution time
  - Enable in hosted zone, create KSK using KMS, and provide public key to domain registrar so it can be forwarded to TLD
