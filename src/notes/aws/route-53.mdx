- Use to route traffic between AWS regions
- Alias records provide Route 53-specific extension to DNS allowing you to route traffic to selected AWS resources such as S3 buckets
- Routing Policies
  - Simple: use for single resource, e.g., web server serving content for example.com. If multiple IPs are provided, Route 53 returns them in random order.
  - Failover: use for active-passive failover, if health checks fail in one region, traffic is routed to healthy region
  - Geolocation: route traffic based on location of users
  - Geoproximity: route traffic based on location of resources and optionally shift traffic using biases from resources in one location to another
  - Latency: route traffic to resources in region providing best latency
  - Multivalue: Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random
  - Weighted: route traffic to multiple resources in proportions you specify
