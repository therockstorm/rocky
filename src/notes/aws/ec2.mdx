- Pricing models
  - On-Demand: fixed-rate by hour or second, no commitments
  - Spot: bid on spare compute for up to 90% off On-Demand prices, can be interrupted
  - Reserved: capacity reservation for one to three year term providing up to 75% off On-Demand prices
  - Dedicated Hosts: physical server dedicated to you, useful for server-bound licenses, purchased On-Demand or Reserved
  - [Comparision site](https://ec2.shop/)
- Instance Store volumes are ephemeral, they can be restarted, but cannot be stopped, will lose data if the underlying host fails, and cannot be kept after termination. Prefer EBS.
- Security Groups
  - By default, all inbound traffic is blocked and all outbound traffic is allowed
  - They are stateful, if you send a request from your instance, response traffic for request is allowed regardless of inbound rules. Similarly, responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules.
  - Only support allow rules, not deny
- Instance metadata available at [http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/](http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/) and user data at [http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/](http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/)
- Placement Groups
  - Clustered: low latency and high throughput networking, each is in close proximity in the same AZ
  - Spread: individual critical instances, each is on separate racks and can be multi-AZ
  - Partitioned: large distributed and replicated workloads with multiple instances, each partition is on separate racks and can be multi-AZ
- Networking
  - Elastic Network Interface (ENI) for basic networking
  - Enhanced Network Adapter (ENA) for speeds between 10 and 100 Gbps
  - Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning (ML), or OS bypass

## Elastic Block Store (EBS)

- By default, root volumes are deleted when the instance is terminated but additional volumes are not
- Always in the same availability zone (AZ) as the running instance
- Volume Types
  - SSD
    - General Purpose (gp2), balances price and performance, max 16,000 IOPS
    - Provisioned IOPS (io1), high performance designed for databases
  - HDD
    - Throughput Optimized (st1), frequently accessed big data, data warehouses, and log processing
    - Cold (sc1), lowest cost for less frequency accessed data
- Snapshots
  - Preferably taken on stopped instances, but not required
  - Stored on S3 and incremental, only blocks changed since last snapshot are saved
  - Automatically encrypted if volume is encrypted
  - Can only share snapshots with other accounts or make public if unencrypted
- To move a volume from one AZ or Region to another
  1. Create a snapshot
  2. If unencrypted, optionally copy snapshot as encrypted
  3. Create an AMI from the snapshot
  4. If moving to a new region, copy AMI to desired region
  5. Use the AMI to launch an instance in desired AZ

## Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

- Use to distribute traffic across multiple targets in a single and across multiple AZs (if enabled)
- To use in a VPC, need a minimum of two public subnets
- 504 means there's likely an issue with your application
- Instance health checks are shown as either `InService` or `OutOfService`
- Get client IP using `X-Forwarded-For` header
- Types
  - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    - Layer 7, allowing for things like path-based traffic routing
    - Preferred for most applications
    - Given DNS name, not IP
  - Network Load Balancer (NLB)
    - Layer 4
    - High performance
    - Can assign a static IP
  - Classic Load Balancer
    - Lower cost, legacy solution
    - Given DNS name, not IP
