- [Storage Lens](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/s3-storage-lens/)
- Object storage, in contrast to EBS
- Bucket names must be globally unique
- Limits
  - Each object can range from zero bytes to five TB bytes with unlimited overall storage
  - Each account has a soft limit of 100 and hard limit of 1000 buckets
- Consistency
  - Read after write for new objects
  - Eventual for updates and deletes
- Security
  - Buckets are private by default
  - Bucket-level access is controlled via Bucket Policies
    - Enables allowing from specific IPs or VPCs, entire internet, only HTTPS connections, require encryption, etc.
    - Useful for centralizing logs from, e.g., CloudTrail, VPC Flow, etc.
      - In central account, set other account ARN (`root`) as `Principal`
      - Also need IAM user policy in other account in order to allow access to the bucket
      - Canned ACLs: set of predefined grants, specified with the `x-amz-acl` header
        - `private` (default), owner `FULL_CONTROL`, others have no rights
        - `public-read` owner `FULL_CONTROL`, others have read read
        - `public-read-write` owner `FULL_CONTROL`, others have read read/write
        - `bucket-owner-read` owner `FULL_CONTROL`, bucket owner has read
        - `bucket-owner-full-control` owner and bucket owner `FULL_CONTROL`
    - If you mistakenly lock yourself out of a bucket, use the root account to edit/delete the policy
  - Object-level access is controlled via Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  - Cross-account object sharing via Bucket Policies, ACLs, or cross-account IAM roles. The latter is preferred, it enables API and Console access instead of only API access.
  - TLS encryption in-transit
  - At rest aka server-side encryption (SSE)
    - S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)
    - Customer master keys stored in Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)
    - Customer-provided keys (SSE-C)
    - Client-side encryption
- Cross or same-region replication
  - Versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets
  - Only new/updated files are replicated after enabling
  - Deletes are not replicated
- Versioning
  - Protects against overwriting and accidental deletion
  - Can still "permanently delete"
  - Once enabled, can only be suspended, not disabled
  - Applies to all objects in the bucket, not a subset
- Lifecycle Policies automate moving objects and/or object versions between storage classes
- Object lock, write once read many (WORM)
  - Requires bucket versioning
  - Ransomware protection
  - Retention modes, can set per object
    - Governance: can be overridden by specific IAM roles
    - Compliance: cannot be overridden, even by root
- S3 Transfer Acceleration uploads files first to CloudFront edge locations (Amazon's content delivery network or CDN) and then over AWS's backbone network to your bucket (or origin in CloudFront language)

Note: All storage classes provide 99.999999999% durability (11 9s)
