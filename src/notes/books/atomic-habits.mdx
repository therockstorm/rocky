- Small habits are powerful because of compounding. Change requires patience and confidence.
- Habits are automated behaviors learned from experience. Cue, craving, response, reward.
- Building new habits requires hard to miss cues. Change surroundings to encourage good habits. Implement intention to lay out specifics of doing something.
- You're motivated by reward, make habits attractive. Desiring is sometimes as good as getting. Commit to only doing something you like while doing something good for you.
- Make habit as easy to adopt as possible. Reduce friction for good, increase for bad. Commit to a two minute rule for food habits. Getting started is hardest. Build on momentum of existing habits with habit stacking.
- Making habits immediately satisfying is key since habits are delayed return. E.g., open trip to Europe account to encourage less eating out.
- Create framework to keep habits on track, either by tracking or negative consequences for not sticking to it. Make commitment with partner.
